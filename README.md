# 🌟 Guess That Phrase 🎉  
*A fun, inclusive game that brings people together through the power of emojis!*

---

## 🎯 Project Overview  
This game challenges players to guess popular phrases, idioms, or sayings based on combinations of emojis.  
For example, with a picture of 🐱, 🐶, 🌧️ it would hint at the phrase **"raining cats and dogs."**  
This project includes three game modes: Easy, Hard and a bonus Spanish level.  
Alongside intuitive sign-up and login processes paired with email functionality so users can notify admins about account issues.

## 💡 Why I Built This  
I wanted to create a game that encourages **inclusive play**, sparks **friendly competition**, and helps people connect through fun and shared cultural references. Emojis were the perfect medium:

- 🌍 **Universally recognized** – no need for translation  
- 💬 **Used daily** by people across the globe  
- 🎮 **Accessible and engaging** for all generations  

While similar concepts exist on platforms like **TikTok** and **Instagram**, there was no standalone desktop app or game built around this idea. This gave the project a **unique selling point (USP)** in a market filled with games based on TV shows like *Catchphrase*.
